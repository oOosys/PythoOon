oOoMindset ( see https://github.com/oOosys/oOo for what oOo is all about ) inspired tools enabling usage of Python programming language as a translator of in oOoCodingStyle written code to a Linux Mint 21.3 Xfce executable.
Currently available are following components of the PythoOon system :

# Motivation
<b>Why PythoOon ?</b><br>
There are many aspects of Python I just don't like, but decades of search for a programming language better suitable to fit to my needs failed. One of the limitations imposed by Python is the range of characters for symbol names ( `[_A-Za-z0-9]` ). In age of worldwide accepted Unicode standard I would like to be able to use its full potential for naming of symbols/variables/identifiers. An attempt to achieve that functionality is `oOoNamespaceDictionary`, but it is only an attempt, so if you have a better idea how to achieve the same effect ... please let me know about it.  

And please NOTICE that PythoOon is only a kind of proof of concept. Usage of the provided tools should be only an inspiration for creating own ones better covering own way of thinking. In other words, PythoOon is only for these ones who feel they need to escape the mainstream trap insisting on the standpoint that you need to learn how to use a system keeping it as it is and refrain from trying to shape it way beyond what it comes with. 

<b>Why has oOo adopted Python programming language as the engine for its oOoCodingStyle ? </b><br>
Because Python is the only programming language with extremely huge amount of "batteries included". If the goal is to refrain from re-inventing the wheel and rewriting anything from scratch to adapt it to own needs, it is the only making sense available choice in shaping the own computer system to understand the Oop (i.e. me, the Operator), instead of learning system's language. 

<i>Another quite important property of Python is that LLMs are best at coding using Python ... way better than writing code in any other programming language (except maybe C, C++)</i> 

Which were other of the over multiple years/decades for the purpose of oOo evaluated programming languages?
- Lua ... the scripting language used by SciTE, TextAdept, and many other applications. Nearest in coding style to oOo ... but ... it lacks so many "batteries", that all the appealing language philosophy is of little use.
- eLisp ... the scripting language used by eMacs. Sure an interesting approach, but it imposes a syntax which is just ... ugly.
- Julia ... nice features, but quite similar to many other languages and ... a niche language which needs more batteries outside of its niche.
- Ruby ... nice alternative to Python, but ... it's just another culture behind it and the amount of "batteries" included way behind Python
- dash/bash ... in their core the best design ever ... extremely near to what oOo is all about, but ... limited to textual oriented tasks, failing at creating GUI applications
- Golang ... needs compilation ... nice syntax ... but ... still shines only in some of the categories Python established itself.
- Rust ... well structured, but ... it's hard to learn and ... it takes hundreds of Megabytes on disk to cover needs of simplest applications. 
- JavaScript, HTML, css ... extremely powerful concept ... but ... there are issues with standalone applications ... depends highly on Web-browser software which size is really huge.
- Lisaac ... it's there ... full download over 200 MBytes ... scarce information ... steep learning curve at the beginning ... 
- awk, Perl, PHP ... shell scripting descendants without the strength to cover all areas of programming needs.
- Java ... it is quite near in style to C++ coding and ... my experience with it was, that it is somehow slow ... in other words: I don't like it.
- C, C++ ... the generated executables are way too large in size compared to what they provide if the code is only some lines ... Would need much more work put into prototyping 
- ... there are many, many more (estimated 50 thousand different ones), starting with Fortran, ALGOL60, apl, Basic, VisualBasic, ... each focusing on another aspect of ... SYNTAX ... but ... 
<br><b>oOo is about SEMANTICS</b><br>
... so it needs anyway an own custom approach to coding and orchestrating software on the own private computer system.
