oOoMindset inspired tools enabling usage of Python programming language as a translator of in oOoCodingStyle written code to a Linux Mint 21.3 Xfce executable.

# Motivation
## Why PythoOon ? Why has oOo adopted Python programming language as the engine for its oOoCodingStyle ? 
Because Python is the only programming language with extremely huge amount of "batteries included". If the goal is to refrain from re-inventing the wheel and rewriting anything from scratch to adapt it to own needs, it is the only making sense available choice in shaping the own computer system to understand the Oop (i.e. me, the Operator), instead of learning system's language. 

<b>Another quite important property of Python is that LLMs are best at coding using Python ... way better than writing code in any other programming language (except maybe C, C++)</b> 

Which were other of the over multiple years/decades for the purpose of oOo evaluated programming languages?
- Lua ... the scripting language used by SciTE, TextAdept, and many other applications. Nearest in coding style to oOo ... but ... it lacks so many "batteries", that all the appealing language philosophy is of little use.
- eLisp ... the scripting language used by eMacs. Sure an interesting approach, but it imposes a syntax shich is just ... ugly.
- Julia ... nice features, but quite similar to many other languages and ... a niche language which needs more batteries outside of its niche.
- Ruby ... nice alternative to Python, but ... it's just another culture behind it and the amount of "batteries" included way behind Python
- dash/bash ... in their core the best design ever ... extremely near to what oOo is all about, but ... limited to textual oriented tasks, failing at creating GUI applications
- Golang ... needs compilation ... nice syntax ... but ... still shines only in some of the categories Python established itself.
- Rust ... well structured, but ... it's hard to learn and ... it takes hundreds of Megabytes on disk to cover needs of simplest applications. 
- JavaScript, HTML, css ... extremely powerful concept ... but ... there are issues with standalone applications ... depends highly on Web-browser software which size is really huge.
- Lisaac ... it's there ... full download over 200 MBytes ... scarce information ... steep learning curve at the beginning ... 
- awk, Perl, PHP ... all quite text oriented ... but all somehow shell scripting descendants without the strength to cover all areas of programming needs.
- Java ... it is quite near in style to C++ coding and ... my experience with it was, that it is somehow slow ... in other words: I don't like it.
- C, C++ ... the generated executables are way too large in size compared to what they provide if the code is only some lines ... Would need much more work put into prototyping 
- ... there are many more, less mainstream ones ... each focusing on another aspect of ... SYNTAX ... but ... oOo is about semantics .. so it needs anyway an own approach to organizing software on a computer system
